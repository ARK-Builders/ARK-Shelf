# ARK Shelf: Reliable Bookmark Keeper by ARK Builders

Don't lose important links in endless chats and browser tabs - whether it's vital information, intriguing content, or something you plan to view later. **ARK Shelf** is perfect for work and study, keeping all your links in one convenient place, just like a bookshelf.

## Easy and Flexible Keeper

Share a link from any app - be it a browser or a messenger - and it will be saved to your phone's memory. This is especially convenient if you use different browsers on the same device. Open a previously saved link in any browser or share it with friends, without the need to wait for it to load.

Our app is light, fast, and has an ultra-simple user interface.

## Sync and Backup

Easily transfer your links to a second device, like a tablet, using third-party apps such as Syncthing or Google Drive. The app stores your links as plain files in a folder of your choice.

## Enhanced Privacy

Your data stays only on your devices. The only time the app goes into internet is when it grabs previews. We respect your privacy and do not collect any personal data.

## Completely autonomous

Even without an internet connection, you can save a link or transfer data to a computer via a cable.

### And also, coming soon:

- **Sorting links** using tags for even better organization. Both manual and automatic, based on link domains.

- **Desktop version** with built-in synchronization will allow you to continue working on another device without data loss.

- **Downloading pages** for offline viewing of important pages.
